# Plaza #

In the middle of the plaza is a small park with Achuran cherry trees, surrounding a small black stone obelisk. It's surprisingly green and refreshing. Around the plaza there are small stores and businesses, and extending into the park on opposite sides there's a caf√© and a restaurant catering to the local populace.

Looking up you gaze first into the commercial district, then into the residential, and if you look straight up, you can see out into space. The lighting may prevent you from seeing the stars during the standard day though.

Of note on the plaza is a nightclub, a bar selling beer brewed in Achurajima, and a public bathhouse with a pool and a gym.

## Cherry Trees ##

The cherry tree has always been a traditional symbol of Achuran culture, as the seasons pass in Achurajima, the trees bloom and people go to the plaza to experience them together.

## Obelisk ##

The black obelisk at the center of the plaza is a rememberence to the crew that perished when Aurora's Basilisk was attacked by Drifters.

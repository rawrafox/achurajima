### Port ###

This alternative docking bay of the Saisio VIII - Moon 4 - Perkone Factory station is known to the locals of Achurajima as just "The Port", and is where goods and people flow in and out of the island. The port isn't big, it seems built for shuttles and frigates at most.

There's always activity, young Achurans packing and unpacking ships, if you look carefully, you can see that they transport everything from traditional necessities such as rice, beans, fish, meat to luxury goods like high-end teas, porcelain, silk, and jewellery.

There's a group of shuttles always on standby as Taxis for capsuleers and their goods to and from the island. While there isn't an Interbus terminal, the taxis can bring you to one if you need to.

While there are on-station routes to get to and from Achurajima to the other populated areas, they are mostly unused and carefully guarded.

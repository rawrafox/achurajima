# Achurajima #

Achurajima or to locals, just "Shima" or "The Island" is a structure inside the Saisio VIII - Moon 4 - Perkone Factory station housing an enclave of Achuran nationalists, freedom fighters, and smugglers.

Founded on a dream of a sovereign Achuran state away from SuVee economical oppression, Achurajima is a strange place where most of the population are ethnic Achurans mostly from the Achura client state, but also from the Caldari controlled areas and the Federation.

Visitors on the other hand are mostly trading partners from Federation and capsuleers of all origins.


## Culture ##

Achurajima culture is a melange of the various Achuran traditions, from the Saisio to the diaspora in the Federation and the State. Catering to most tastes there's everything from tranquil traditional Achuran gardens and hot springs, to imports like Karaoke and Nightclubs.

That everyone has access to more than enough money to survive on the Island has led to a high demand for good entertainment and quality goods, even in the regular shops capsuleers won't be disappointed with the quality, even if it is lower than what they usually have access to in station.

While everyone seems to be welcoming or at least ignore capsuleers in general, capsuleers from the Caldari State may get strange looks on the streets and a slightly colder reaction in general.


## Districts ##

Converted from an old shipyard, Achurajima's basic shape is that of a circular high-rise building with an internal plaza. On top of the high-rise there's a dome containing a park and recreational area and some more smaller structures.

There's four elevator buildings located in the Temple district, the park, the town, next to the Ryokan in the gardens. In each building there's four elevator shafts, these service every level down to the port. In addition there's an elevator on the outside of the building connecting the Courtyard district with all other levels with two private elevators reserved for visitors.

Starting from the rooftop districts going clockwise, the courtyard district, the temple district, the park, the town, the garden. Going down the residential district, the commercial district, the plaza, the storehouses, and finally the port.
